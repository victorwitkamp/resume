# Resume Repository Improvements Summary

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### PDF Skills Styling (Primary Issue)
- **Problem**: ATS-friendly CSS removed all visual styling from skills blocks, making them appear as plain text
- **Solution**: Implemented balanced approach that maintains ATS compatibility while providing visual distinction
- **Changes Made**:
  - Added subtle light gray background (`#f8f8f8`) for skills blocks
  - Added minimal border (`1px solid #e0e0e0`) for visual separation
  - Maintained ATS-friendly fonts and colors
  - Used appropriate padding and margins for readability
  - Skills now appear as styled blocks in PDF while remaining ATS-parseable
