# üìò Project Best Practices

## 1. Project Purpose  
This project is a personal resume and portfolio site for Victor Witkamp. It is designed to showcase professional experience, certifications, and education, and is deployed as a static site using GitHub Pages with Jekyll. The site also provides a downloadable PDF version of the resume, generated automatically from Markdown sources.

## 2. Project Structure
- **Root Directory**: Contains configuration files for Jekyll, GitHub Actions workflows, and project metadata.
- **src/**: Contains all content files, including:
  - `RESUME.md`: Main resume in Markdown, includes professional summary and links to sections.
  - `Education.md`, `Certifications.md`, `WorkExperience.md`: Sectional content in Markdown.
  - `PDF.css`: Enhanced stylesheet for PDF generation with professional styling.
  - `assets/images/`: Certification badge images and other visual assets.
- **.github/workflows/**: Contains the `jekyll-gh-pages.yml` workflow for CI/CD, PDF generation, and deployment.
- **_config.yml**: Jekyll configuration, theme, and site metadata.
- **README.md**: Main project documentation and entry point.
- **LICENSE**: MIT license for the project.
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Guidelines for contributing to the project.
- **.gitignore**: Excludes build artifacts and temporary files.

## 3. Test Strategy
- No automated code tests are present, as this is a static content and site generation project.
- Manual validation is performed by reviewing the generated site and PDF output after each change.
- GitHub Actions workflow ensures build and deploy steps complete successfully.

## 4. Code Style
- **Markdown**: Use clear, consistent heading levels and bullet points. Prefer semantic sectioning (e.g., `###` for job titles, `-` for lists).
- **CSS**: Professional styling with print optimization, responsive design, and proper typography.
- **YAML**: Use clear indentation and comments for configuration and workflow files.
- **Naming**: Use PascalCase for Markdown files, lowercase for assets and CSS, organized folder structure.
- **Documentation**: Keep Markdown files well-commented and up to date with proper metadata.
- **Error Handling**: Ensure all referenced files (images, CSS) exist and are linked correctly with relative paths.
- **Image Organization**: Store all images in `src/assets/images/` with descriptive filenames.
- **Version Control**: Use `.gitignore` to exclude build artifacts and maintain clean repository.

## 5. Common Patterns
- Modular content: Each resume section is a separate Markdown file, included via links.
- Automated PDF generation: Uses Pandoc in CI to convert Markdown to PDF with custom CSS.
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD: Automates build, PDF generation, and deployment to GitHub Pages.
- Jekyll for static site generation and theming.

## 6. Do's and Don'ts
### ‚úÖ Do's
- ‚úÖ Keep all content modular and up to date in the `src/` directory.
- ‚úÖ Validate the site and PDF after changes using local testing.
- ‚úÖ Use clear, descriptive commit messages following conventional format.
- ‚úÖ Keep configuration and workflow files well-commented with error handling.
- ‚úÖ Organize assets properly in `src/assets/images/` directory.
- ‚úÖ Use professional styling and maintain responsive design.
- ‚úÖ Include proper metadata and titles for PDF generation.
- ‚úÖ Follow security best practices in workflows and dependencies.
- ‚úÖ Maintain documentation currency and accuracy.

### ‚ùå Don'ts
- ‚ùå Don't hardcode file paths; use relative paths for portability.
- ‚ùå Don't add sensitive or personal data not intended for public view.
- ‚ùå Don't bypass the CI/CD workflow for deployment.
- ‚ùå Don't commit build artifacts, temporary files, or dependencies.
- ‚ùå Don't use absolute URLs for internal navigation.
- ‚ùå Don't ignore broken links or missing image references.
- ‚ùå Don't skip testing changes locally before committing.
- ‚ùå Don't use inconsistent formatting or styling across sections.

## 7. Tools & Dependencies
- **Jekyll**: Static site generator, configured via `_config.yml`.
- **GitHub Pages**: Hosting and deployment.
- **GitHub Actions**: Workflow for build, PDF generation (Pandoc), and deployment.
- **Pandoc**: Converts Markdown to PDF using custom CSS.
- **pages-themes/slate**: Jekyll theme for site styling.

## 8. Other Notes
- All resume content is in English with professional formatting.
- The workflow expects all referenced files (Markdown, images, CSS) to be present in `src/`.
- When adding new sections, update both the Markdown navigation and the workflow if needed.
- The project is optimized for clarity, maintainability, and ease of update for a personal portfolio/resume use case.
- Images are organized in `src/assets/images/` with proper relative path references.
- Build artifacts are excluded via `.gitignore` to maintain repository cleanliness.
- Security considerations include minimal workflow permissions and dependency management.
- Professional styling ensures consistent appearance across web and PDF formats.
