# Security Best Practices

## ðŸ”’ Security Considerations for Resume Repository

### Workflow Security
- **Minimal Permissions**: GitHub Actions workflow uses least-privilege permissions
- **Dependency Management**: Pin action versions to specific commits for reproducibility
- **Secret Management**: No secrets or sensitive data stored in repository
- **Build Isolation**: Each workflow run uses fresh containers

### Content Security
- **Personal Information**: Only include professional information intended for public view
- **Image Optimization**: Certification images are optimized and contain no metadata
- **Link Validation**: All external links are to reputable professional platforms
- **No Executables**: Repository contains only text, images, and configuration files

### Repository Security
- **Branch Protection**: Main branch should be protected with required reviews
- **Access Control**: Limit repository access to necessary contributors
- **Audit Trail**: All changes tracked through Git history
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular updates to GitHub Actions and dependencies

### Recommendations
1. **Enable Dependabot**: Automatic dependency updates and security alerts
2. **Code Scanning**: Enable GitHub's code scanning for security issues
3. **Review External Links**: Regularly validate external links and references
4. **Monitor Workflow Logs**: Check for any suspicious activity in build logs
5. **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Regularly update action versions and dependencies

### Privacy Considerations
- Personal contact information is limited to professional contexts
- No sensitive personal details included in public repository
- Certification images are public credentials intended for verification
- Repository is designed for professional networking and job applications
